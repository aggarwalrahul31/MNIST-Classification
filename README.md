# MNIST-Classification
MNIST Digit classification with different parameters,optimizers using Pytorch

In this part we will cover the following:

    Learn to play with tensors on numpy and pytorch.
    Learn to build a simple feed forward network.
    Learn to build an end to end MLP for MNIST dataset.
    Check train and validation error using different optimizers and parameters.
    Select best optimizer and parameter as per best validation error.
